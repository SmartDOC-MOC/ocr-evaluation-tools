.SH NAME
accci \- computes a confidence interval for character accuracy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B accci
[ -f report_files_list | accuracy_report1 accuracy_report2 ... ] >resultfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Accci
reads two or more character accuracy reports and writes to stdout an
approximate 95% confidence interval for character accuracy.  Each input report
is treated as one observation, and normally has been produced for a single page
using
.IR accuracy .
The confidence interval is computed using a technique known as jackknife
estimation which assumes that the observations are independent.  For best
results, at least 30 observations are needed.
