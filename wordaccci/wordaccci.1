.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wordaccci
reads two or more word accuracy reports and writes to stdout an
approximate 95% confidence interval for word accuracy.  Each input report
is treated as one observation, and normally has been produced for a single page
using
.IR wordacc .
The confidence interval is computed using a technique known as jackknife
estimation which assumes that the observations are independent.  For best
results, at least 30 observations are needed.
